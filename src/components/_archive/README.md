# Archived Components

This directory contains code that was developed but is not currently used in the active application.

## rekordbox-ui-exploration/

Alternative UI components styled after Pioneer Rekordbox DJ software:
- `VirtualDJDeck_Rekordbox.tsx` - Rekordbox-styled deck component
- `Crossfader_Rekordbox.tsx` - Rekordbox-styled crossfader
- `Mixer_Rekordbox.tsx` - Rekordbox-styled mixer

**Why archived:** These were exploratory UI variants that were never integrated into the main app flow. The app currently uses:
- `VirtualDJDeck.tsx` (basic version) for simple lessons
- `VirtualDJDeck_Professional.tsx` for advanced tutorials

**Preserved for:** Potential future UI theming options or reference designs.
