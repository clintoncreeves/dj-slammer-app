## The DJ Deck Layout

You have **two decks** - think of them like two record players:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                        DECK A (Cyan)                        │
│  [Waveform Display]                                         │
│  [PLAY] [CUE] [SYNC]     [EQ: LOW MID HIGH]    [VOLUME]    │
│                          [TEMPO]                            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

                    ════════════════════════
                         CROSSFADER
                    ════════════════════════

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                      DECK B (Magenta)                       │
│  [Waveform Display]                                         │
│  [PLAY] [CUE] [SYNC]     [EQ: LOW MID HIGH]    [VOLUME]    │
│                          [TEMPO]                            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Basic Controls

### Play & Pause
- **PLAY button**: Start the music
- Click **PLAY** again to pause

### The Crossfader (Most Important!)
The crossfader is the horizontal slider in the middle. It controls which deck you hear:
- **All the way LEFT**: You only hear Deck A
- **All the way RIGHT**: You only hear Deck B
- **In the MIDDLE**: You hear both decks mixed together

**This is how you transition between songs!**

### CUE Button
- Sets a "bookmark" in the song
- Click CUE to jump back to that spot
- Great for finding the perfect starting point

### SYNC Button
- Matches the tempo (speed) of one deck to the other
- Makes beatmatching much easier!

---

## The EQ (Equalizer)

Each deck has three EQ sliders:
- **LOW**: Controls the bass (the boom boom)
- **MID**: Controls the middle frequencies (vocals, instruments)
- **HIGH**: Controls the treble (hi-hats, cymbals)

### Pro DJ Trick: The Bass Swap
When transitioning between songs:
1. Cut the LOW on the incoming song (Deck B) before you start the crossfade
2. As you crossfade to the middle, both songs play but only ONE has bass
3. When you're mostly on Deck B, bring the LOW back up on Deck B and cut it on Deck A
4. This prevents the bass from two songs clashing!

### Double-Click Shortcuts
- **Double-click TOP of slider**: Goes to maximum
- **Double-click MIDDLE of slider**: Goes to center (0 dB)
- **Double-click BOTTOM of slider**: Goes to minimum

---

## The Tempo Slider

Controls how fast the song plays:
- **Slide UP**: Song plays faster
- **Slide DOWN**: Song plays slower
- **Double-click**: Resets to original speed

Use this to manually match the BPM (beats per minute) of two songs, or just click SYNC!

---

## The Volume Fader

Controls how loud each deck is (separate from crossfader):
- **Slide UP**: Louder
- **Slide DOWN**: Quieter

### Double-Click Shortcuts
- **Double-click TOP**: Goes to 100%
- **Double-click MIDDLE**: Goes to 50%
- **Double-click BOTTOM**: Goes to 0% (mute)

---

## The Waveform Display

The colorful wave shows you the song visually:
- **Bright peaks** = loud parts (drops, choruses)
- **Quiet sections** = breakdowns, intros
- The **white line** shows where you are in the song
- The **orange triangle** shows your CUE point

Click anywhere on the waveform to jump to that spot!

---

## Loading Tracks

### From the Track Library
1. Click the **Track Library** to expand it
2. Click a track to select it
3. Click **"Load A"** or **"Load B"** to load it onto a deck

### Upload Your Own Music
1. Click the **"+ Upload"** button in the track library
2. Select MP3 files from your computer
3. The app will analyze the BPM automatically

---

## Your First Mix (Step by Step)

1. **Load a track onto Deck A** and press PLAY
2. **Move the crossfader all the way LEFT** so you only hear Deck A
3. **Load a different track onto Deck B**
4. **Press SYNC on Deck B** to match the tempo
5. **Press PLAY on Deck B** (you won't hear it yet because crossfader is left)
6. **Cut the LOW EQ on Deck B** (drag it down)
7. **Slowly move the crossfader to the CENTER** - now you hear both!
8. **Swap the bass**: Bring up Deck B's LOW, cut Deck A's LOW
9. **Continue sliding the crossfader RIGHT** until you only hear Deck B
10. **Congratulations!** You just did your first mix!

## Tips for Better Mixing

### 1. Listen to the Beat
Try to start the new song so the beats line up. The "1" of Deck B should hit at the same time as the "1" of Deck A.

### 2. Use Phrases
Songs are built in 8-bar or 16-bar phrases. Start your mix at the beginning of a phrase for smoother transitions.

### 3. Match the Energy
Pick songs that flow together. Going from a slow song to a fast one can feel jarring.

### 4. Practice the Bass Swap
This is the #1 technique that separates beginner DJs from good DJs. Never have two basslines playing at the same time!

### 5. Use the CUE Point
Find a good starting point in your song (usually after the intro) and set your CUE there. This way you can quickly restart if you mess up.

## Troubleshooting

### No sound?
- Make sure you clicked to enable audio on the welcome screen
- Check that the crossfader isn't all the way to the opposite deck
- Check the volume sliders aren't at zero

### Songs sound weird together?
- Make sure you pressed SYNC to match the tempos
- Try the bass swap technique so basslines don't clash

### Can't find the beat?
- Use the waveform - the peaks usually show the beats
- Press CUE to set a point, then tap PLAY to the beat
